## Code Style Preferences

- Use **TypeScript** with explicit types for registries and component props.
- Mark any component that uses hooks or state with `"use client"` at the top.
- Prefer clear Tailwind class names over overly compressed utility chains.

## Assistance Preferences

- When refactoring or adding features, align with the existing patterns:
  - Use the registry + Sandpack + theme-injection model already established.
  - Prefer enhancing the existing layout and registry setup instead of creating new architectures.
- When suggesting changes:
  - Favor focused snippets over full-file rewrites unless necessary.
  - Keep changes compatible with static export and the no-persistence rules.
- Testing suggestions should prioritize:
  - Running `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` after structural changes.
  - Verifying that component pages, Sandpack previews, theme switching, and example anchors work as expected.
