## Static Next.js Configuration

- Set `output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts` and keep the app fully static-exportable.
- Ensure all routes are statically generatable:
  - Use `generateStaticParams` (or equivalent App Router patterns) for dynamic routes such as `app/component/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Avoid server-only features:
  - Do not introduce API routes.
  - Do not use `getServerSideProps` or server-only runtime hooks.
  - Avoid any feature that would require a Node server at runtime.
