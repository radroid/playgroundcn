## No Persistence, Backend, or Auth

- Do not use any persistence APIs:
  - No `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, cookies, IndexedDB, or similar storage.
- Do not introduce any backend or database:
  - No Next.js API routes.
  - No Convex or other RPC/database layers.
  - No calls that assume a custom server.
- Do not add authentication:
  - No login, signup, user accounts, or access control flows.
- All edits and selections (code edits, theme choice, etc.) must live only in memory:
  - Refreshing the page should reset everything to registry defaults.
