## Multiple Examples Pattern

- Each component entry should define `examples: { id; name; code }[]`.
- On `/component/[id]` pages:
  - Render one `ComponentPlayground` per example, stacked vertically.
  - Do not use tabs to switch between examples.

## Anchors and Linking

- For each example, add a heading with a stable `id`, e.g.:
  - `<h2 id={example.id}>{example.name}</h2>`.
- Allow URLs like `/component/button#outline` to scroll to the appropriate example.
- Keep editor state isolated per example, but share the same selected theme across all examples on the page.
