## Tailwind Usage Model

- Tailwind must run **only** in the host Next.js app:
  - Configure it via `tailwind.config.ts`.
  - Import `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` only in `app/globals.css`.
- Do not attempt to run Tailwind inside Sandpack:
  - Do not use `@tailwind` directives in any CSS that will be loaded into Sandpack.
  - Do not reference or import `tailwind.config` from Sandpack files.
- Sandpack styling is provided via precompiled CSS strings:
  - Theme CSS lives in `lib/registry/themes.ts` as plain CSS strings.
  - Sandpack gets those strings as the content of `/globals.css` and never runs Tailwind itself.
