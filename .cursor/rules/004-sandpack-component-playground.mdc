## ComponentPlayground Contract

- `ComponentPlayground` must be a **client component** (`"use client"`).
- It should accept at least:
  - `exampleCode: string`
  - `template: string` (default `"react-ts"`)
  - `dependencies: Record<string, string>`
  - `globalsCss: string` (CSS string for `/globals.css`)
  - `title: string`

## Sandpack Files Map

- Each Sandpack instance should define:
  - `/App.tsx` — editable example code (`exampleCode`).
  - `/index.tsx` — imports `"./globals.css"` and renders `<App />`.
  - `/globals.css` — CSS content of the selected theme (no `@tailwind`).

## Layout Expectations

- Editor and preview should appear:
  - Side-by-side on desktop.
  - Stacked vertically on smaller screens.
- All Sandpack logic must run on the client; do not attempt to SSR Sandpack.
